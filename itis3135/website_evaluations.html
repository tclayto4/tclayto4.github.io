            <h3><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/">The Home Depot</a></h3>
            <h3>Good Example</h3>
            <p>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast
                   <p>Very good contrast throughout, mainly using a white background with bold black text. When background changes colors, so does the font color in order to maintain good contrast.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Repetition
                    <p>They use a variety of font sizes and have two diffrent types of text, bold and regular. Good variety without going over board.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Alignment
                    <p>Very good vertical and horizontal alignment, consistent throughout the website. All the sections are also center aligned.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Proximity
                    <p>Good proximity throughout, but the margins between sections in the center of the page could be a little larger to make it easier to differentiate blocks of information.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a></h3>
            <h3>Bad Example</h3>
            <p>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast
                    <p>This website does a good job with their contrast between the background and text color as it only uses white as a background and purple for the text.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Repetition
                    <P> This website is very repetitive but I would say that it is too repetive. The same font color is used for almost all of the text on the page and that causes it to feel all cluttered and bunched up.</P>
                </li>
                <li>Alignment
                    <p>The alignment on this website is straight aligned but not centered. I think it is quite clean but its not vertically aligned and looks unorganized when going from top to bottom. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Proximity
                    <P>Needs more space inbetween each section of categoy. Looks too bunched up as is and very cluttered.</P>
                </li>
            </ul>
