        <h2>What</h2>
        <p>Car modification is customizing the look, performance, sound, or feel of your car with the use of aftermarket parts, modified stock parts, or custom parts. While most hobbiest customize their cars to their own liking, it is also sometimes to show off at events. There are standard car meets that are that generally attrach members of the community that aim for stance or static builds which are for looks and appearance. On the other side of the spectrum there are also preformance oriendet events such as track meets and drift meets where hobbiest can put their preformance modifications to the test.  </p>

    <section id="who" class="page">
        <h2>Who</h2>
        <p>I got into the hobby right after I got my first car in junior year of high school. I didnt have a flashy car by any means but I liked to work on it because it gave me a sense of satisfation from working on something as large as a vehicle. I for sure wasnt doing any preformance modifications to this car as thats just not the type of car it was but I did still try to modify it to my liking by upgrading the sound system in the car and mild costmetic modificaitons like window tint.</p>

        <figcaption>Moderatly modified Volkswagen Golf GTI, the same generation as my old one.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>That was how I initally got started but after a long period of saving money, in my freshman year of college I got what I consider to be my first real car. It was a used and well loved Volkswagen GTI which is a platform that is known for its customizability and aftermarket support. I put a lot of time and money into that car, installing new parts, making parts for it, and general up keep. Unfortunaley about a year after I got it, I then lost it due to a hydroplanning accident. This was devistating obviously but I try to look at it as an opprotunity to be able to experience more diffrent cars in my lifetime.</p>

        <img src="itis3135/hobby/images/a4.png" alt="Audi a4">
        </figure>
        <p>My next car following the GTI and my current car is an Audi A4. Also used and from several years ago, but I plan to give this car new life and transform it to my liking over the time of my ownership. So far not much has been done preformance wise, but cosmetically, it has new wheels, lowered suspention, a rear ducktail spoiler, tint, aftermarket front grille, and a new sound system all installed by me.  </p>

    <section id="when" class="page">
        <h2>When</h2>
        <p>I dont think this hobby really has a specific season that it has to take place in, but I would say that meets are generally more popular in the warmer seasons just because they are usally help outdoors. The only execption I can kind of think of is that when the winter season rolls around, you tent to see a lot of "boost season" specials and sales from manufatures. This is because of turbocharged cars being able to better utailze the colder air climates as it is heavily impacts the effecentcy of turbocharged systems.   </p>

    <section id="where" class="page">
        <h2>Where</h2>
        <p>Everywhere! You can find car communitys anywhere you look in almost every country. Usally big meets happen in the major cities but you can find smaller events almost anywhere in moderatley populated areas. Bigger meets tend to do a lot of promotion leading up to big events to encourage a highger turnout, the main thing is just to keep an eye out on social media to stay in the loop. 
        </p>
        <p>Local drag strips and tracks tend to host open events every weekend if you were interested in putting your car to the test in preformance applications. Many tracks require the proper saftey equipment dependant on the regulations of the track. Some things that might be required are a five point harness, racing helment with neck brace, roll cages, fire extinguishers, etc.</p>

    <section id="how" class="page">
        <h2>How</h2>
        <p>There isnt really any right way or how to car modificaiton, its esentially all persoanl preference as to what you want to do to your car. You can get ideas from either going to car meets in person, watching videos online, seeing pictures online or anything really. As for doing the actual modificaitons you can either take it to local mechanic shops that will do the work or do it yourself with the help of video tutorials or online fourms and other sources.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="why" class="page">
        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>But why should I modify my car or get into this hobby? Modifing your own car allows you to personalize the second largest investment you'll have in your life, the only larger one being the purchase of a home typically. It brings out your personality and style in the form of a 2 ton block of metal that can go highway speeds.</p>
        <p>Personalization and customization is a big reason for me but I think the overall reason I enjoy modifiying cars is the mechanical and technical aspects that I dont really experience anywhere else. The feeling of working on a project all day and being able to wrap it up at the end of the day and appreicate your hard work is the most satisfying feeling ever and thats what keeps me starting new mini projects on my car. Being able to work on things like this increasees your proplem solving ability in my opinion and can help applications outside of cars also.</p>
