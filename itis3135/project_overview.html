    <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> [Calculated Car Audio Creations]</p>

    <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
    <p>Calculated Car Audio Creations aims to fill the gap of a calculator for common metrics when working with car audio fabrication, installation, and tuning settings. Our purpose is to create an easier and more DIY friendly approach to the car audio industry. Our goal is to make an easy to use application to assist any potential DIY'ers in the car audio space. The biggest feature for car audio fabrication would be the box volume calculator to ensure that the speaker housing you are making is consistent with the required air volume measurements of your driver. We will have guides going over the required tools and how to utilize them properly in the fabrication process. For tuning we will have a rms voltage calculator that gives out the proper rms voltage values that your specific driver needs. The goal is to take the guessing work out of the process and to provide an all in one system that has everything you need to do it on your own. We will also have wiring guides on the various wiring methods you can use to achieve different ohm levels for your audio setup.</p>

    <h2>Dynamic Functionality on the Website:</h2>
    <p>On the home page will utilize clickable tiles for all of the calculators and pages. With the box volume calculator I will have input boxes for dimensions and required volume. For the tool section of the fabrication guide I will have a checklist on the margins for users. The tuning page will have drop downs that explain each setting on the amplifiers. I will also have the rms voltage calculator here with inputs for target wattage, amplifier rms and resistance. I'll have a sound deadening estimator that predicts the required sq ft of material the user should buy for the project.</p>
